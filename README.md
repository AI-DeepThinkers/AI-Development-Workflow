# AI Ethics, Bias & Workflow – Hospital Readmission Prediction

This document outlines the critical thinking, ethical considerations, and development workflow of an AI system designed to predict hospital patient readmission within 30 days.

## Part 3: Critical Thinking

### Ethics & Bias

- **Biased Training Data Effects:**
  - Underrepresentation of minority groups can result in poor predictions for those patients.
  - May lead to delayed care, misallocated resources, or overlooked high-risk cases.

- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Perform fairness audits (evaluate model across age, race, gender groups).
  - Use techniques like reweighting or stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation.
  - Involve clinicians in reviewing model outputs to catch real-world implications.

---

### Trade-offs: Accuracy vs Interpretability

- **Interpretability:**
  - Essential in healthcare to build trust.
  - Enables clinicians to understand and validate predictions.
  - Easier to comply with healthcare regulations and ensure accountability.

- **Accuracy:**
  - More complex models (e.g., ensemble methods) may capture hidden patterns.
  - However, these models are often black boxes and hard to explain.

- **Best Practice:**
  - Use explainable models (e.g., Random Forest + SHAP values) to balance performance and transparency.

---

### Computational Constraints

- If the hospital lacks powerful infrastructure:
  - Avoid deep learning or large ensemble models.
  - Prefer lighter models like logistic regression, decision trees, or pruned random forests.
  - Consider using cloud-based inference if privacy and bandwidth permit.

## Part 4: Reflection & Workflow

### Reflection

- **Most Challenging Stage:**
  - Balancing fairness and performance was the hardest.
  - Healthcare data is sensitive and messy, and addressing ethical concerns adds complexity.

- **Improvements with More Resources:**
  - Collect more diverse patient data and include social factors (e.g., income, support system).
  - Apply model explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME).
  - Collaborate closely with medical staff for validation.

## AI Development Workflow

**Workflow Stages:**

1. **Problem Definition** – Define prediction goal and identify key stakeholders.
2. **Data Collection** – Gather EHRs, demographics, and historical readmission data.
3. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Clean data, extract clinical features, and handle missing values.
4. **Model Selection & Training** – Choose model based on interpretability and resource limits.
5. **Evaluation** – Use metrics like precision, recall, and fairness scores.
6. **Deployment** – Integrate with hospital systems e.g., FastAPI for inference.

## Notes

- This file focuses on the **thinking process**, not the implementation.
- See `notebooks/` or `models/` folders for training code and evaluation.
